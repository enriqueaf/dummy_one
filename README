How to install:
==============
 Run in the shell ./install.sh inside the folder where is the unpacked driver.

How to user:
============
 The configuration file can be found at $ONE_LOCATION/etc/one_dummy.conf, by now
it is only supported the self-containing mode.

 The structure of the configuration file is:
----------------------------------------------------
im:
  host_name:
    parameter: value # comment
vmm:
  action: value
  action-WAIT: seconds
------------------------------------------------------

By now you have two different parameters that you can configurate for a host:
  - CPU: It is how many cores the cpu have, the number must be given cores*100,
ej: 100 for a host of one core, 500 for a host of five cores.
  - FREECPU: By now you can set how much cpu it is free. 

 All of those values are read in the fly, I mean, every time ONE ask for those
parameters, this files is read and the response is made with the new parameters
given.

 For the VM, here in the configuration file is set the default options because
you can configurate the behaviour of every VM in it CONTEXT using the DUMMY
flag, this will be explain later.

The actions which can be configurate are:
 - SUSPEND
 - SHUTDOWN
 - CANCEL
 - DEPLOY
 - RESTORE
 - MIGRATE

For every of those action you can set, three parameters: 
 - NORMAL: The action will finish as soon as it is execute succesfully 
 - FAIL: The action will fail after the action-WAIT seconds
 - WAIT: The action will finish succesfully after the action-WAIT

Configurating the DUMMY flag inside the CONTEXT of a VM:
--------------------------------------------------------
 There is other option for configurating a VM, and not using the default
parameters, which are explained before. The vm can be configurated inside its
context, there is a file called ttylinux.one where you can find an example. The
actions that can be configurate are the same as in the configuration file and
the parameters also, the only thing that change is it is not action-WAIT if not
action_sleep.

Example:
--------------------------------------------------------------
DUMMY =[
   suspend = "sleep",
   suspend_sleep = "60"
]
--------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
====
 - Change the behaviour of poll for responsing a fail status after the VM have
been deployed during X seconds, or after been asked X times.
